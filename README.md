This section covers the Queue data structure, a fundamental concept in Java that operates on the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.

Definition and Characteristics: Explained Queue as a collection where the first element added is the first one to be removed, making it suitable for scenarios requiring orderly processing.

Basic Operations: Demonstrated key operations such as enqueue (adding an element to the rear), dequeue (removing an element from the front), and peek (viewing the front element without removing it).

Types of Queues: Discussed various types of queues, including simple queues, circular queues, priority queues, and double-ended queues (deques), highlighting their unique characteristics and use cases.

Implementation: Provided examples of queue implementation using both arrays and linked lists, noting differences in memory efficiency and performance.

Common Use Cases: Illustrated practical applications of queues, such as task scheduling, breadth-first search algorithms, and managing requests in a print queue.

Advantages and Limitations: Analyzed the benefits of queues for managing data in order and their limitations, such as potential waste of space in static implementations.
